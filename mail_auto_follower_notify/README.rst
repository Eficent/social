=========================
Mail Auto Follower Notify
=========================

With this module users assigned to leads, tasks, issues... will receive an
automatic notification in their email address containing the last discussion
message in the thread.

Some instances where this is valuable is when a lead is created from an
incoming email, and a sales manager assigns it to a salesman. This person
will then receive a notification in his mailbox including the details of the
email from the customer.

This feature existed in 8.0, but was removed as of 9.0.

Configuration
=============

In order to work correctly, the model must meet the following conditions:

* Should inherit from 'mail.thread'.
* The field representing the user should have *track_visibility='onchange'*
  in the field definition.


Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Start a conversation for an existing record (e.g. Lead, Task..).
#. Assign the record to a user.
#. A email notification is sent to the assigned user containing the last
   conversation message.
